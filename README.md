# Mobile AIOT
source code for **Analyzing Data Access Characteristics of AIoT Workloads for Efficient Write Buffer Management**

## How To
1. `python popularity.py`: Visualization of File Block Popularity Skewness
  * Generates a graph illustrating the skewness in access frequency among file blocks.
2. `python estimator.py`: Comparison of Recency and Frequency Estimators
  * Evaluates and compares the effectiveness of recency-based and frequency-based access estimators.
3. `python simulation.py`: Simulation of the Proposed Algorithm
  * Runs simulations of the proposed algorithm and measures the resulting write traffic to assess its performance.
